# GPU Value Proposition Chart

_How much do you value a certain GPU?_

This is an experimental tool for evaluating a GPU's value proposition, inspired by Gamer's Nexus.
It is essentially a glorified FPS/Dollar calculator, but with additional features and parameters.

The GPU dataset is transcribed from the Gamer's Nexus RX 9070 Review (FFXIV 4K Benchmark), and combined with data automatically collected from TechPowerUp.
Actual GPU price data is collected from the very scientific method of checking on eBay, and copying the first legit looking price I see.

You should expect the performance and price data to be inaccurate,
but you can add your own data and see how different GPUs stack up against each other.

If you are interested in this code, feel free to fork it.
Though I would not recommend forking this complete mess of a code base.
Starting from scratch would probably be easier, since the idea itself isn't that complicated.
